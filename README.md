Hi [Hiring Manager],

I noticed you need a Data Analyst who can [specific requirement from job posting].

Yesterday I completed a churn analysis that identified $2.4M in recoverable revenue using the exact skills you're looking for:
- SQL for customer segmentation
- Python for predictive modeling (87% accuracy)
- Business insight translation for executives
